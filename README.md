# Mod-3-Project-Hotel Bookings and Cancellations

#### About the Data: The Hotel Bookings and Cancellation Dataset is available at Kaggle. The Dataset consists of several classification and linear variables. This dataset could be used several ways, but for the purpose of this project, we will try to predict and identify key features that lead to a booking cancellation.

#### Objective: The Objective is to try different Machine Learning models and see if their is any meaningful relationship between the variables in this dataset.

#### Business Case: It would be helpful to identify a business case for this project. One potential Business case would be to identify the factors that affect or lead to booking cancellations. If for example, a certain room type, gets cancelled the most by a certain cvategory of customer, the Hotel could use the infomation to possibly reduce cancellations.
